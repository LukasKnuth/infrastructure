# Infrastructure

This repository holds all infrastructure configuration for my personal and hobby projects.

It's organized by having one project per folder. See each folders Readme for further information, if necessary.

Any sensitive information (e.g. API Keys) is provided via environment variables. These are loaded via [direnv](https://direnv.net/), which also makes them all available in any sub-directory.
